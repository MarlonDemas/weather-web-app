        <h1>Welcome to the Adept Junior Frontend test</h1>
        <p>We have set this small Vue app up for you to help you get started.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We will be looking at coding ability as well as any extras you implement beyond the scope provided. 
            This doesn't mean that you need to implement machine learning... 
            However, if you wish to use a css framework such a bootstrap, you are more than welcome to and it will count in your favour.</p>
